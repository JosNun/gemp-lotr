# Bot notes

Working notes on generalising the GEMP bot beyond the FotR starters. Everything here
runs headless from this directory; no Docker, no database.

## Running it

```bash
./bot-vs-bot.sh aragorn gandalf --games 200                       # one matchup
./bot-vs-bot.sh --suite starters:test --a general@bot-models-exp/general --b fotr
./bot-vs-bot.sh --list-starters                                   # ~90 starters, by site block
./bot-train.sh --bot general --suite starters:train --out bot-models-exp/x
```

Both scripts rebuild `gemp-lotr-server` when a `.java` file under server, logic or
common is newer than the jar. **Do not edit Java sources while a training run is
going**: the next script call rebuilds the jar under the running JVM, which loads
classes lazily.

Bots (`--a`, `--b`): `fotr` (the shipped bot on `bot-models/`), `general` (the same
bot with its extensions on, see `FotrStarterBot.extended`), `random`, and
`fotr@<dir>` / `general@<dir>` for either on another model directory. A and B swap
decks every game, so a strong deck cannot pass for a strong bot.

Suites: `starters` pairs every starter with the next one of the same site block,
under that block's format (`fotr_block`, `ttt_block`, `king_block`, `expanded`).
`starters:train` / `starters:test` are alternate halves of each block. **Train on
`train`, score on `test`** -- the point is decks the bot has never seen. Three SotP
starters name cards the library lacks and are skipped.

## The metric

Head-to-head win rate of the new bot against the current one over `starters:test`,
20 games per matchup (~1,000 games, about 35s), reported with its 95% interval
(+-3 points at 1,000 games). Read it per format too. Against `random` every bot so
far wins 92-96%, which is too close to the ceiling to separate them.

"guessed N answers per game" counts decisions a bot answered at random because no
model or rule covered them, plus answers the engine rejected. Fewer is not the same
as stronger -- see below.

## What was measured (2026-10-17)

| Bot A | Bot B | Held-out decks |
|---|---|---|
| shipped `fotr` | `random` | 93.9% +- 1.5 |
| retrained on `starters:train`, 4 gens x 4000 | shipped | **65.5% +- 2.9** (62-68% every format) |
| same, on FotR starters only | shipped | 11.5% +- 2.0 |
| `general` (extensions + 3 more gens) | shipped | **70.1% +- 2.8** |
| `general` | same models, extensions off | 50.4% +- 3.1 |
| `general`, trees (`--model trees`, same protocol) | `general`, logistic | 46.2% +- 3.1 |
| `general`, trees | shipped | 68.1% +- 2.9 |
| *after the bug fixes below, same protocol (`--init diverse`, 3 gens x 4000):* | | |
| v1 retrained (`bot-models-exp/v1`) | shipped | 69.6% +- 2.9 |
| feature set 2 (`bot-models-exp/v2`) | shipped | 65.6% +- 2.9 |
| feature set 2 | v1 retrained | **49.7% +- 3.1** (48-52% every format) |
| feature set 2, trees | v1 retrained | 47.0% +- 3.1 |
| **feature set 2, final** (race block, vitality fixed; `bot-models-exp/v2`) | v1 retrained | **49.4% +- 3.1** |
| feature set 2, final | shipped | 65.3% +- 3.0 |

- **Diverse decks generalise; more of the same deck does not.** The FotR-only
  retrain ties the shipped bot on its own matchup (51.7%) and collapses elsewhere
  (62% against random). Retraining on varied starters lost nothing on FotR (51.0%)
  and won everywhere else.
- **The extensions halved random answers (4.2 -> 2.0 a game) and won nothing.**
  Neither did three more generations. That points at the model, not the coverage:

## The linear-model ceiling

Every card-action model scores each option as `sigmoid(w.state + v.card + b)`, and the
state vector is the same for every option of a decision. So `w.state` shifts every
option equally and never changes which one wins: "play X" beats "pass" exactly when
`v.card > 0`, whatever the twilight, wounds or board. The logistic bot is a fixed
card ranking. `TreeModel` (gradient-boosted trees behind the same `SoftClassifier`
interface, `BotTrain --model trees`) can split on state and card together.

**Trees did not help (46.2% +- 3.1 against logistic, same protocol).** The likely reason
is the label, not the model: every decision in a won game is labelled good, so a model
free to use the state mostly learns which *states* win, and the option's own effect is
lost in that noise. The logistic model is forced to put everything in the card term.
Either way, better decisions need a signal about the decision, not about the game.

## Lookahead is within reach

All of the engine's randomness is four `ThreadLocalRandom` calls (`GameState` deck
shuffle, `GameUtils`, `ChooseSeatingOrderGameProcess`, `DiscardCardAtRandomFromHandEffect`).
Routed through a seeded per-game `Random`, a game becomes replayable from its seed and
decision log, and so can be branched at any decision: play each option out a few times
with the current bot and keep the one that wins most. That is slow per decision but
exactly the signal the models lack, and it can teach them (label each decision with
what the rollouts preferred) so the fast bot learns it. Unverified: whether iteration
over identity-hashed sets (effect results, triggers) keeps a replay on the same path --
test replay determinism before building on it. Rollouts with the real seed see the
shuffled deck, so as a *teacher* that is fine; as a player it would cheat.

## Feature set 2 (`--features 2`)

A model directory's `features.txt` says which set its models were trained on (none =
1); the bot reads it and feeds them only that set, so bots on either set share a
process. `CardFeatures.version()` is thread-local, set by the bot around each decision
and by BotTrain around training.

- **State** (`GeneralStateFeatures`, ~64 numbers, one layout for every decision): the
  board by *side* -- Free Peoples companions, Shadow minions -- with `iAmFp` saying which
  side the bot is on, so the Shadow bot finally sees its own minions; modified strength,
  vitality and resistance (the engine's `getResistance` already subtracts burdens);
  site, threats, initiative, move limit; hand composition; the current skirmish's
  margin from the bot's side; phase one-hot. No deck identity.
- **Card**: set 1's 22, plus resistance, unique, 22 keywords as counts (damage, fierce,
  archer, ambush, toil...), culture and race one-hot.
- **State x option** (`CardFeatures.join`): 11 state features times a 12-number summary
  of the option's card, appended wherever a trainer scores one option per card. This is
  what lets a logistic model's choice depend on the board at all.

Training a new set from models of the old one: the old models play generation 0
(`FotrStarterBot.recordWith`) and the steps record the new set's state; no old model is
copied into the new directory, and a model that cannot be fit becomes a
`ConstantModel` (every option ties).

### Do the features know who is winning? (`BotProbe`)

`BOT_MAIN=com.gempukku.lotro.bots.simulation.BotProbe ./bot-vs-bot.sh --suite starters:test --games 60`
records both sets' state at every card-action decision of the same games, fits
P(decider wins | state) on 80% of the games, and reports held-out AUC -- a one-minute
check of a feature change, where a training run takes half an hour.

- First version of set 2: **0.687 against set 1's 0.750**. It described only the active
  board, and the Shadow player's own fellowship is inactive -- invisible, though it is
  half of whether that player wins. Fixed by a per-player race block (burdens,
  resistance, companions, vitality, wounds, dead).
- After: 0.764 against 0.769 on 3,000 games, and 0.757 against 0.765 with the vitality
  fix; standardising the inputs changes neither.
  The board's information about the result is about saturated near 0.77 with summary
  features, and set 1 already had most of it. What set 2 adds is in the option terms --
  which only pay if the label rewards a good choice. That is the case for working on
  the signal (lookahead) next, with set 2 as the features the student learns from.

The set-2 directories trained before the race block (`v2`, `v2-trees`) were deleted:
the state grew, and `CardFeatures.join` refuses a state of the wrong length. So was
`v2-race` (47.5% +- 3.1 against v1, 72.1% against shipped), for a subtler reason: it
subtracted wounds from `ModifiersQuerying.getVitality`, which already has them taken off
-- a fellowship with 3 vitality left on its weakest member read as -2. Same length, so it
would have loaded and been fed differently scaled inputs. **Dump a few vectors by name
(`PROBE_DUMP=1` with BotProbe) after any feature change**; that is how this was seen.

## Other things found

- **The engine can loop forever without asking for a decision.**
  `TurnProcedure.carryOutPendingActionsUntilDecisionNeeded` only stops at a pending
  decision or a winner; about 2 games in 1,000 between starters spin there (seen in
  Regroup and Archery). On the live server that table would hang. `BotGame` ends such
  a game after 60s and reports it as `engine stuck`.
- `FotrStartersRLGameStateFeatures` counts minions owned by the *opponent*, so when the
  bot is the Shadow player its own minions are invisible to it. Strengths are printed,
  not modified. "Deck index" is 1 for Aragorn's starter, 2 for Gandalf's, 0 for
  everything else.
- `RandomDecisionBot.chooseIntegerDecision` used `Math.min(range, 1)`, so it always
  answered the minimum -- and overflowed to an exception when max was
  `Integer.MAX_VALUE`. Now it returns the minimum on purpose.
- **Bots throwing is silent on the server**: `BotGameStateListener` falls back to a
  default answer. `BotGame.BOT_ERRORS` counts them and BotVsBot prints them;
  `BOT_TRACE=1` prints the first stack of each (add
  `JAVA_OPTS=-XX:-OmitStackTraceInFastThrow`, or a hot NPE arrives with no stack). It
  found: the set-1 features crashing on cards with no side (`getSide()` is null for
  some) -- the shipped bot answered those decisions at random off the FotR starters;
  the "general" site rule parsing temporary ids (`temp0`) and never running, which is
  part of why the extensions measured as nothing; set 2 reading hands before the deal.
- Set 1 trained the "pass" option of skirmish card actions on a different vector than
  it scored it with (`getCardFeatures(PASS, action)` vs `getPassCardFeatures()`); now
  the same. Live bots no longer keep every decision in memory when nothing collects
  them (the named server bots did, forever).
- `ActionChoiceAction` has no JSON form in `SemanticActionFactory`; those steps are
  dropped from training (no trainer reads them).

## Next steps, roughly in order

1. Make replays deterministic (seeded `Random`), verify by replaying recorded games, then
   use rollouts as a teacher.
2. (Done as feature set 2. It ties set 1 -- logistic or trees, in play and in BotProbe.)
3. A bigger, more varied training pool than ~45 starters: the Deck Library, or decks
   generated per format.
4. Better credit than "every decision in a won game was good": e.g. reward per turn
   from burdens/wounds/site reached, or comparing against the model's own estimate.
